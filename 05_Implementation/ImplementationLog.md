- ✅ Verified TypeScript strict mode configuration
  - All strict mode flags enabled
  - noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters, noFallthroughCasesInSwitch enabled
- ✅ Created project directory structure
  - Frontend: components/{editor,sidebar,ai,common,layout}, hooks, stores, services, utils, types, styles
  - Backend: src-tauri/src/{commands,services,models,utils}
- ✅ Tested development environment
  - `npm run tauri dev` successfully starts
  - Vite dev server running on http://localhost:1420/
  - Rust backend compiles successfully

### Problems Encountered
- WebKit2GTK development packages not installed
  - Note: Cannot install system packages without sudo in this environment
  - Solution: Documented for manual installation later (libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev, librsvg2-dev)
  - Impact: None for now, but needed for actual app window to open
  
- npm create tauri-app command line parsing issue
  - First attempt created directory named `--name` instead of `personal-os`
  - Solution: Used different command format, then moved files to root directory

### Decisions Made
- Use master branch (default from git init) instead of main
- Set local git config for repository rather than global config
- Create Tailwind config files manually instead of using npx init
- Keep documentation directories separate from source code
- Place Tauri project files in root alongside documentation

### Code Added
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive exclusions for Node, Rust, IDE, build artifacts
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration with dark mode
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `src/index.css` - Tailwind directives
- `src/main.tsx` - Updated to import index.css
- Directory structure created (no code files yet)

### Testing
- Verified Rust installation: `rustc --version` → 1.90.0
- Verified Node.js: `node --version` → v20.19.5
- Verified Tauri CLI: `cargo tauri --version` → 2.8.4
- Tested build process: `npm run tauri dev` successfully starts
- Vite dev server confirmed running
- Rust cargo successfully downloading and compiling dependencies

### Next Steps
- [ ] Install missing system packages manually (libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev, librsvg2-dev)
- [ ] Start Phase 1: Basic File System
  - [ ] Implement `read_directory` command (Rust)
  - [ ] Implement `read_file` command (Rust)
  - [ ] Create FileTree component (React)
  - [ ] Create App layout (sidebar + main area)

### Notes

## 2025-10-09 - Phase 1 Complete: Basic File System ✅

### Accomplished
- ✅ **Backend (Rust) - Complete file system commands**
  - Created path validation utilities (prevent directory traversal attacks)
  - Implemented `FileEntry` data model with Serialize/Deserialize
  - Implemented `get_home_directory` command
  - Implemented `read_directory` command (lists files with metadata, sorted)
  - Implemented `read_file` command (with 10MB size limit, UTF-8 validation)
  - Registered all commands in Tauri app
  - Added dependencies: `dirs` 5.0, `chrono` 0.4

- ✅ **Frontend (TypeScript/React) - Complete UI implementation**
  - Created TypeScript types matching Rust models
  - Created file service layer wrapping Tauri invoke commands
  - Created Zustand store for state management
    - Directory navigation
    - File selection
    - Content loading
    - Error handling
  - Created FileItem component (with Lucide icons)
  - Created FileTree component (with loading/error states)
  - Created Sidebar component (with navigation buttons)
  - Created ContentPane component (displays file content)
  - Created AppLayout component (two-column layout)
  - Updated App.tsx to initialize with home directory

- ✅ **Testing**
  - Application compiles successfully (Rust + TypeScript)
  - Vite dev server starts without errors
  - Only minor warnings (unused functions for future use)

### Problems Encountered
None! Implementation went smoothly following the plan.

### Decisions Made
- **File size limit**: Set to 10MB to prevent memory issues
- **Sorting**: Directories first, then alphabetically by name
- **Error handling**: User-friendly messages, don't expose full system paths
- **Icons**: Used Lucide React (Folder and File icons)
- **Layout**: Fixed 320px sidebar width, flexible content pane
- **Navigation**: Home button and "up" button for easy directory traversal

### Code Added

**Backend (8 files)**
- `src-tauri/src/utils/mod.rs` - Module declaration
- `src-tauri/src/utils/path.rs` - Path validation (canonicalize, validate)
- `src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs` - Module declaration
- `src-tauri/src/models/file.rs` - FileEntry struct
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Module declaration
- `src-tauri/src/commands/file.rs` - File system commands (3 commands)
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Updated to register modules and commands
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added dirs and chrono dependencies

**Frontend (11 files)**
- `src/types/file.ts` - TypeScript FileEntry interface
- `src/services/fileService.ts` - Tauri invoke wrappers
- `src/stores/fileStore.ts` - Zustand state management
- `src/components/sidebar/FileItem.tsx` - Individual file/folder item
- `src/components/sidebar/FileTree.tsx` - File list display
- `src/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx` - Sidebar container with nav
- `src/components/layout/ContentPane.tsx` - File content display
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Main app layout
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated to use new layout
- `src/hooks/` - Directory created (for future use)
- `src/components/common/`, `src/components/ai/`, `src/components/editor/` - Directories created

**Total**: 19 new files, ~600 lines of code

### Testing Results
- ✅ Application compiles without errors
- ✅ Rust backend builds successfully
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ Vite dev server starts
- ⏳ Manual UI testing pending (requires webkit packages installed)

### Architecture Highlights
- **Security**: All file paths validated and canonicalized
- **Error handling**: Proper Result types in Rust, try/catch in TypeScript
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage, strict mode enabled
- **State management**: Clean Zustand store with actions
- **Component structure**: Well-organized, single responsibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support

### Next Steps
- [ ] Manual testing with actual file browsing
- [ ] Start Phase 2: Markdown Editor
  - [ ] Integrate CodeMirror 6
  - [ ] Implement save functionality
  - [ ] Add syntax highlighting

### Notes

## Example Future Entry

```markdown
## 2025-10-15 - Implemented File Tree Component

### Accomplished
- Created FileTree React component
- Implemented recursive directory traversal
- Added expand/collapse functionality
- Styled with Tailwind CSS

### Problems Encountered
- Rust fs::read_dir was slow for large directories
  - Solution: Added pagination, load folders on demand
  
- TypeScript complained about recursive types
  - Solution: Used interface with optional children property

### Decisions Made
- Load folders lazily (only when expanded)
- Show max 1000 items per folder
- Use react-window for virtualization if needed later

### Code Added
- `src/components/sidebar/FileTree.tsx`
- `src/components/sidebar/FileItem.tsx`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/file.rs` (list_directory command)

### Testing
- Tested with small vault (100 files) - works perfectly
- Tested with large vault (5000 files) - loads in <1 second
- Tested nested folders (10 levels deep) - no issues

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add right-click context menu
- [ ] Implement file creation
- [ ] Add icons for different file types

### Notes
- Lazy loading was the right choice
- Need to add error handling for permission denied
- Consider adding .gitignore support later

### Time Spent
- 3 hours
```
