  - Lucide React for icons
  - Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
  - @types/node for TypeScript
- ✅ Configured Tailwind CSS

- ✅ Verified TypeScript strict mode configuration
  - All strict mode flags enabled
  - noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters, noFallthroughCasesInSwitch enabled
- ✅ Created project directory structure
  - Frontend: components/{editor,sidebar,ai,common,layout}, hooks, stores, services, utils, types, styles
  - Backend: src-tauri/src/{commands,services,models,utils}
- ✅ Tested development environment
  - `npm run tauri dev` successfully starts
  - Vite dev server running on http://localhost:1420/
  - Rust backend compiles successfully

### Problems Encountered
- WebKit2GTK development packages not installed
  - Note: Cannot install system packages without sudo in this environment
  - Solution: Documented for manual installation later (libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev, librsvg2-dev)
  - Impact: None for now, but needed for actual app window to open
  
- npm create tauri-app command line parsing issue
  - First attempt created directory named `--name` instead of `personal-os`
  - Solution: Used different command format, then moved files to root directory

### Decisions Made
- Use master branch (default from git init) instead of main
- Set local git config for repository rather than global config
- Create Tailwind config files manually instead of using npx init
- Keep documentation directories separate from source code
- Place Tauri project files in root alongside documentation

### Code Added
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive exclusions for Node, Rust, IDE, build artifacts
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration with dark mode
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `src/index.css` - Tailwind directives
- `src/main.tsx` - Updated to import index.css
- Directory structure created (no code files yet)

### Testing
- Verified Rust installation: `rustc --version` → 1.90.0
- Verified Node.js: `node --version` → v20.19.5
- Verified Tauri CLI: `cargo tauri --version` → 2.8.4
- Tested build process: `npm run tauri dev` successfully starts
- Vite dev server confirmed running
- Rust cargo successfully downloading and compiling dependencies

### Next Steps
- [ ] Install missing system packages manually (libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev, librsvg2-dev)

  - [ ] Implement `read_directory` command (Rust)
  - [ ] Implement `read_file` command (Rust)
  - [ ] Create FileTree component (React)
  - [ ] Create App layout (sidebar + main area)

### Notes

- All dependencies installed and verified
- Project structure follows documentation exactly
- Ready to begin Phase 1 development
- Git repository connected to GitHub and documentation pushed
- TypeScript strict mode already configured perfectly by Tauri template

## Example Future Entry

```markdown
## 2025-10-15 - Implemented File Tree Component

### Accomplished
- Created FileTree React component
- Implemented recursive directory traversal
- Added expand/collapse functionality
- Styled with Tailwind CSS

### Problems Encountered
- Rust fs::read_dir was slow for large directories
  - Solution: Added pagination, load folders on demand
  
- TypeScript complained about recursive types
  - Solution: Used interface with optional children property

### Decisions Made
- Load folders lazily (only when expanded)
- Show max 1000 items per folder
- Use react-window for virtualization if needed later

### Code Added
- `src/components/sidebar/FileTree.tsx`
- `src/components/sidebar/FileItem.tsx`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/file.rs` (list_directory command)

### Testing
- Tested with small vault (100 files) - works perfectly
- Tested with large vault (5000 files) - loads in <1 second
- Tested nested folders (10 levels deep) - no issues

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add right-click context menu
- [ ] Implement file creation
- [ ] Add icons for different file types

### Notes
- Lazy loading was the right choice
- Need to add error handling for permission denied
- Consider adding .gitignore support later

### Time Spent
- 3 hours
