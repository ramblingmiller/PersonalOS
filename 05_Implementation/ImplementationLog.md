## 2025-10-08 - Project Kickoff

### Accomplished
- âœ… Created comprehensive documentation suite
  - Foundation documents (Charter, Requirements, Decisions)
  - Architecture documents (Technical, Data Model, Security)
  - Design documents (UI/UX, Design System, User Flows)
  - Development documents (Setup, Tech Stack, Standards, Structure)
  - Implementation documents (Roadmap, Features, Log)
  - Testing documents (Strategy, Test Plan)
  - Operations documents (Build/Deploy, Maintenance)

### Decisions Made
- Confirmed Tauri as the framework (ADR-001)
- No web app version (ADR-002)
- Not an Obsidian plugin (ADR-003)
- React for frontend (ADR-004)
- CodeMirror 6 for editor (ADR-005)
- Local-first, no cloud sync (ADR-006)
- BYOK for AI (ADR-007)
- Single vault initially (ADR-008)
- SQLite for indexing (ADR-009)
- Documentation before code (ADR-010)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Verify Tauri installation
- [ ] Create project structure
- [ ] Get empty Tauri window running

### Notes
- Starting fresh after previous chaotic attempts
- Documentation-first approach to avoid previous mistakes
- Clear vision established

## Example Future Entry

```markdown
## 2025-10-15 - Implemented File Tree Component

### Accomplished
- Created FileTree React component
- Implemented recursive directory traversal
- Added expand/collapse functionality
- Styled with Tailwind CSS

### Problems Encountered
- Rust fs::read_dir was slow for large directories
  - Solution: Added pagination, load folders on demand
  
- TypeScript complained about recursive types
  - Solution: Used interface with optional children property

### Decisions Made
- Load folders lazily (only when expanded)
- Show max 1000 items per folder
- Use react-window for virtualization if needed later

### Code Added
- `src/components/sidebar/FileTree.tsx`
- `src/components/sidebar/FileItem.tsx`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/file.rs` (list_directory command)

### Testing
- Tested with small vault (100 files) - works perfectly
- Tested with large vault (5000 files) - loads in <1 second
- Tested nested folders (10 levels deep) - no issues

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add right-click context menu
- [ ] Implement file creation
- [ ] Add icons for different file types

### Notes
- Lazy loading was the right choice
- Need to add error handling for permission denied
- Consider adding .gitignore support later

### Time Spent
- 3 hours
```
