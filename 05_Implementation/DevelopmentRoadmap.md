## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Rust Learning Curve**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple commands, learn incrementally
   - Use Tauri examples as reference

2. **CodeMirror Integration**
   - Mitigation: Use official React integration
   - Start with basic setup, add features gradually

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Profile early, optimize as needed
   - Use SQLite indexing for search

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Stick to phases, resist adding features
   - Refer back to ProjectCharter when tempted

2. **Lost Motivation**
   - Mitigation: Celebrate small wins
   - Start using the app as soon as Phase 2 is done

3. **Time Estimates**
   - Mitigation: Phases are guidelines, not deadlines
   - It's okay if it takes longer

---

## Next Steps

**Right now**:
1. Finish Phase 0 (documentation) ‚úÖ
2. Verify Tauri installation
3. Create project structure
4. Get empty window running

**Then**:
1. Start Phase 1 (file system)
2. One feature at a time
3. Test each feature before moving on
