# PersonalOS Decision Log

## Purpose

This document records all significant technical and design decisions. Each decision follows the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format.

---

## ADR-001: Use Tauri Instead of Electron

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Accepted ‚úÖ

### Context
Need to build a cross-platform desktop application. Previous attempts with Electron resulted in:
- Frequent environment breaking
- Large bundle sizes
- Complex configuration
- Dependency hell

### Decision
Use **Tauri** as the application framework.

### Rationale
1. **Stability**: Rust backend is more stable than Node.js
2. **Size**: ~10MB vs ~100MB for Electron
3. **Security**: Sandboxed by default, explicit permissions
4. **Performance**: Native code vs JavaScript runtime
5. **Development**: Still use web technologies for UI
6. **Community**: Active, growing, good documentation

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Smaller binary size
- Better performance
- Forced to learn Rust (valuable skill)
- More secure by design
- Better system integration

**Negative**:
- Learning curve for Rust
- Smaller ecosystem than Electron
- Fewer examples/tutorials
- Some npm packages may not work

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Electron** - ‚ùå Rejected: Previous bad experience, too large, too complex
2. **Neutralino** - ‚ùå Smaller community, less mature
3. **Native App (C++/Qt)** - ‚ùå Too much complexity, steep learning curve

5. **Previous Failure**: Already tried web app, hit permission issues

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Full file system access
- Better performance
- True offline capability
- No browser compatibility issues

**Negative**:
- Larger initial setup
- Platform-specific builds required
- No "try in browser" demo
- Deployment more complex

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - ‚ùå File System Access API too limited, security restrictions
2. **Hybrid (Web + Desktop)** - ‚ùå Doubles maintenance, splits focus
