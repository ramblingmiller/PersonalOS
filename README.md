# PersonalOS - Documentation Suite

## Overview

PersonalOS is a desktop application that combines AI-powered coding assistance (Cursor-style) with knowledge management capabilities (Obsidian-style). It's built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript, following the philosophy: **"VSCode/Cursor WITH Obsidian capabilities"**.

## Documentation Structure

This project follows a **documentation-first** approach. All planning and architectural documents are complete before any code is written.

### üìÅ 01_Foundation/
Core project documents that define what PersonalOS is and why it exists.

- **ProjectCharter.md** - Project vision, goals, scope, and success criteria
- **RequirementsSpecification.md** - Functional and non-functional requirements
- **DecisionLog.md** - All major technical and design decisions (ADRs)

### üìÅ 02_Architecture/
Technical architecture and system design.

- **TechnicalArchitecture.md** - System architecture, components, data flow
- **DataModel.md** - Database schema, file formats, data structures
- **SecurityArchitecture.md** - Security principles, threat model, best practices

### üìÅ 03_Design/
UI/UX specifications and design system.

- **UIUXSpecification.md** - UI layouts, components, interactions
- **DesignSystem.md** - Colors, typography, design tokens, components
- **UserFlows.md** - User journeys and interaction flows

### üìÅ 04_Development/
Development setup and coding guidelines.

- **DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup.md** - Step-by-step setup instructions
- **TechnologyStack.md** - Technologies used and rationale
- **CodingStandards.md** - Code style, conventions, best practices
- **ProjectStructure.md** - Directory layout and file organization

### üìÅ 05_Implementation/
Implementation planning and tracking.

- **DevelopmentRoadmap.md** - Phased development plan with timeline
- **FeatureSpecifications.md** - Detailed feature specifications
- **ImplementationLog.md** - Daily progress tracking (template included)

### üìÅ 06_Testing/
Testing strategy and test plans.

- **TestingStrategy.md** - Testing approach, levels, and philosophy
- **TestPlan.md** - Specific test cases and acceptance criteria

### üìÅ 07_Operations/
Build, deployment, and maintenance procedures.

- **BuildAndDeployment.md** - Build process and release procedures
- **MaintenanceGuide.md** - Ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting

## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 0 - Foundation (Documentation) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

All documentation has been created. Next steps:
1. Verify Tauri installation
2. Create project structure
3. Begin Phase 1: Basic File System

## Key Decisions

- **Framework**: Tauri (not Electron)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI**: OpenAI/Anthropic (BYOK)
- **Philosophy**: Local-first, privacy-focused

See `01_Foundation/DecisionLog.md` for full rationale.

## Getting Started

### For Development
1. Read `04_Development/DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup.md`
2. Follow setup instructions
3. Verify Tauri runs with `npm run tauri dev`
4. Start Phase 1 tasks from `05_Implementation/DevelopmentRoadmap.md`

### For Understanding the Project
1. Start with `01_Foundation/ProjectCharter.md`
2. Review `02_Architecture/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
3. Check `05_Implementation/DevelopmentRoadmap.md` for current status

## Documentation Guidelines

### Keeping Docs Up-to-Date
- Update ImplementationLog.md daily during development
- Update feature specs when features change
- Update ADRs when major decisions are made
- Review and update docs quarterly

### Adding New Documents
- Follow existing structure
- Use YAML frontmatter
- Include revision history
- Cross-reference related docs

## Project Principles

1. **Documentation First**: Plan before coding
2. **Single Technology**: Stick with chosen stack (no alternatives mid-project)
3. **Clear Scope**: Refer to charter when tempted by feature creep
4. **Incremental Development**: One phase at a time
5. **Test as You Go**: Don't skip testing

## Timeline

- **Phase 0**: Week 1-2 (Documentation) ‚úÖ Complete
- **Phase 1**: Week 3-4 (File System)
- **Phase 2**: Week 5-6 (Editor)
- **Phase 3**: Week 7-8 (Navigation)
- **Phase 4**: Week 9-10 (AI Integration)
- **Phase 5**: Week 11-12 (Polish & Daily Use)
- **Phase 6**: Month 4+ (Advanced Features)

**Goal**: Working, daily-usable MVP in ~12 weeks
